# SigComply Evidence SPA — Claude Context

Static React SPA that renders **declaration forms only**. The user accepts a declaration, downloads an `evidence.json`, and uploads it to their own storage bucket. The CLI picks it up on the next run.

Document/screenshot evidence does NOT flow through this SPA — customers upload PDFs/images directly into their evidence bucket. The SPA exists only for controls that require a structured user attestation with no underlying file.

This app has **no backend** — it only reads a pre-built catalog JSON and writes JSON files to the user's disk via browser download.

## How Data Flows

1. **Build time** — `prebuild` runs `scripts/fetch-catalogs.ts`, which shells out to `sigcomply evidence catalog --framework <fw>` and writes `src/data/catalogs/{fw}.json`. Also fetches `schema.json` via `sigcomply evidence schema`. Vite then emits these into `dist/data/catalogs/`.
2. **App start** — `main.tsx` calls `loadConfig()` which fetches `/config.json` (frameworks available, storage prefix). Cached on module.
3. **Dashboard** — reads `getConfig().frameworks`, picks one (from localStorage or picker dialog), calls `useCatalog(framework)`, and **filters the catalog to `evidence_type === "declaration"`**. Document-upload and checklist entries are hidden from the UI; the CLI catalog command still emits them so other tooling can see what exists.
4. **Evidence form** — only renders for declaration entries. `useEvidenceForm` manages accept/completed-by state, validates on submit, calls `downloadJson()` to trigger a browser download of `evidence.json`, then shows the upload-path instructions screen. A guard in `EvidenceForm` redirects any non-declaration `evidenceId` with a "uploaded directly to your bucket" message.

Flow is one-way: catalog → form → downloaded JSON. **Nothing is ever uploaded from the browser.** The user moves the file to their own bucket manually (or via any tool they like).

## Contracts with Sibling Repos

These are the only cross-repo contracts. Break them at your peril.

| What | Shape | Producer | Consumer |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Catalog JSON | `Catalog` in `src/types/catalog.ts` | `sigcomply-cli` (`evidence catalog`) | this SPA |
| Submitted evidence JSON | `SubmittedEvidence` in `src/types/submitted.ts` | this SPA | `sigcomply-cli` reader |
| Storage path | `{prefix}/{framework}/{evidenceId}/{period}/evidence.json` | `src/lib/storage-path.ts` | CLI `internal/data_sources/manual/reader.go` |
| Period key format | `2026`, `2026-Q1`, `2026-03`, `2026-W14`, `2026-04-18` | `src/lib/period.ts` | CLI period package |

If `CatalogEntry` or `SubmittedEvidence` changes, update the Go types in `sigcomply-cli` in the same PR.

The ground-truth design doc is `../PLAN-manual-evidence.md` — Phase 1 (catalog types) and Phase 9 (SPA) are the sections that apply here.

---

## Runtime Config (`public/config.json`)

Loaded once at startup. Shape:

```json
{
  "frameworks": ["soc2"],
  "storage": { "show_upload_path": true, "prefix": "manual-evidence" }
}
```

Missing `config.json` → falls back to the default in `src/config/runtime.ts`. Deploys override by replacing `config.json` in the hosting bucket — no rebuild needed.

---

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # vite dev server (no prebuild — uses committed catalogs)
npm run fetch-catalogs   # regenerate src/data/catalogs/*.json from local sigcomply CLI
npm run build            # prebuild (fetch-catalogs) + tsc -b + vite build
npm run lint             # eslint
npm run preview          # serve dist/
```

`fetch-catalogs` requires `sigcomply` on PATH. If unavailable, use the pre-committed JSONs in `src/data/catalogs/`.

Base path: `VITE_BASE_PATH` env var (defaults to `/`). Set when deploying to a subpath.

---

## Conventions

- **Add a UI primitive** → `npx shadcn add <name>` (writes to `src/components/ui/`). Do not hand-author.
- **Add a new declaration entry** → it comes from the CLI catalog automatically; nothing to add here.
- **Need a new evidence-input flow that isn't a declaration?** → first ask whether the evidence already exists as a file (PDF/screenshot). If yes, the customer should upload it directly to the bucket — do NOT add a new form type to this SPA. The SPA is intentionally scoped to declarations only.
- **Add a new framework** → list it in `public/config.json` `frameworks` and in `scripts/fetch-catalogs.ts`. Catalog JSON is sourced from the CLI, not hand-written.
- **localStorage keys** — namespaced `sigcomply:*` (e.g. `sigcomply:framework`, `sigcomply:completed-by`). Keep that prefix.
- **Imports** — use `@/…` not relative `../../`.
- **No data fetching libraries** — plain `fetch` + `useEffect` is enough here; don't introduce React Query / SWR for two endpoints.

---

## Gotchas

- `useCatalog` resets `catalog` to `null` in its effect cleanup. Components must handle the loading state even on framework switch — don't assume catalog persists.
- `currentPeriod()` uses local time, not UTC. Period boundaries are the browser's midnight. This matches CLI behaviour as long as the CI runner's timezone matches the user's — revisit if we hit drift.
- Catalog fetch is cached in `catalogCache` Map (module-level). Hard refresh clears it.
- `prebuild` will fail the whole build if `sigcomply` is not on PATH. For CI, install the CLI before `npm run build`, or pre-commit the catalog JSONs and skip the prebuild.
- The shadcn `ui/` folder is generated — don't refactor it, and don't lint-fix it by hand.
